Coarse-grained force fields



## Install this package

Run the following in the package root directory
```
pip install [-e] .
```
where the optional `-e` flag specifies that we want to install in *editable* mode, which means that when we edit the files in our package we do not need to re-install the package before the changes come into effect. You will need to either restart Python or reload the package though!
